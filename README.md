# Joke Bot
This repository contains the test robot for home orchestrator.
It only checks if it is weekend or weekday, warns if the current time is over 5:05 pm or not, asks if you want to play music and finally opens excel to work. 
If it is a weekend, and they don't want to play music, it makes a joke and then opens the travel page. 

With the .bat file you can run the robot, obviously you must have UiPath Robot installed on the pc and check that the paths written in the file are correct.
